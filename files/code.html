						<p>
							All of our programming is done in RobotC. It is generally quite nice, using easily-editable text files that compile very quickly.
							The only significant downside is its Windows-exclusivity. Mac users can of course edit programs, but they can't compile them or use RobotC's joystick control.

					<div class = 'panel-body'>
						<p>
							We use Git to keep track of all our code that is not for testing or needs to be shared around the team.
							All of our code resides in one repository on <a href = 'https://github.com/'>GitHub</a>, which allows us to share files between our autonomous program and our tele-op program.
							GitHub was very kind to give us free private repositories, which is a great offer to any FTC team using RobotC.
							This is useful so we can quickly see what has changed, have previous versions to which to rollback, and to make updating everyone's version of the code much more streamlined.
							It also saves space to only keep track of changes than to store old versions of entire files, as we did last year.
							Git makes it very easy for anyone to start programming, as they only have to pull the repository instead of downloading each file individually.
							It is also easier for new programmers to work on the team's code because they don't have to worry about making a change that we can't easily revert if it doesn't work.

						<p>
							We use Xander Soldaat's <a href = 'http://botbench.com/blog/robotc-driver-suite/'>RobotC Driver Suite</a> for all sensor usage, which is especially useful for sensors like the IR sensor, which has many different values to be read.
							The <a href = 'http://botbench.com/driversuite/group__tmr.html'>Timer Library</a> is also very useful for doing functions that require a timeout inside a constantly looping loop.
							<br /><br />
							For joystick control, we use a modified version of RobotC's built-in JoystickDriver.c.
							We found that we can harm our robot significantly if the Samantha Module loses connectivity to the FCS, which can't be detected by JoystickDriver.c.
							Read more <a href = 'http://www.technoguards.org/node/407'>here</a>.
							We modified this code a little bit to make it more readable and to base the timeout on time instead of number of checks in a row that didn't see a new message, for greater accuracy.
							See our version <a href = '/code/ModdedJoystickDriver.c'>here</a>.

							Our autonomous program uses a switch-case structure inside an infinite loop.
							The first autonomous program we made was linear and used waits, but we quickly realized that it was important to be able to continuously update the power going to the driver motors and we also wanted the ability to datalog at every part of the program.

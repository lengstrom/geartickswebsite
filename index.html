					Our club participates in the <a href = 'http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/ftc'>FIRST Tech Challenge</a> (FTC), an intense robotics competition that requires great commitment from team members. The ultimate goal of FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) and of our robotics program is to educate the leaders of tomorrow in the engineering process and to teach students to innovate to solve both small and global problems.
				</p>
				
				<p>We have done FTC for two years, and many team members have been on an <a href = 'http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/fll'>FLL</a> team for many years prior.</p>

				<p>Last year we made it to the state finals as a rookie team, along with winning multiple awards. This year, we won the Inspire Award, combining robot performance, engineering process, programming, and outreach, at the state competition and will be going to the <a href = 'http://www.ftceast.org/'>Super-regional Competition</a>.</p>

				<p>We are learning many new skills in FTC. The first, and one of the most important is how to use tools safely. There are fourteen people on our team this year and the meetings tend to get very hectic, so we are learning to stay on task.

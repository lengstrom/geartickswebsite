					Our club participates in the FIRST Tech Challenge (FTC), an intense robotics competition that requires great commitment from team members. The ultimate goal of FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) and by extension of this club is to educate the leaders of tomorrow in the engineering process and to teach students to innovate to solve both small and global problems. Last year we made it to the state finals as a rookie team, winning multiple awards on the way.
